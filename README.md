# TutoringSignup

This program has a user input their list of 'student needing tutoring' as a Javascript variable.  

The program then opens the tutoring website, Flexisched, and searches for a student in the list.  

The student is then signed up for Tuesday.  Then this process is repeated for the next student.  

Improvements to be made:  Improve student list input UI, tutoring day choice, disable signup if already scheduled for another teacher.
